# Word Search Explorer

Word Search Explorer is a web-based tool that allows users to uncover hidden words in a grid using different search algorithms. Whether you want a uniform or non-uniform search, this project has you covered.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/aditya-choudhary599/Grid-Word-Search.git>
    ```

2. Open `main.html` in your favorite web browser.

## Usage

1. Input the grid dimensions (rows and columns).
2. Fill in the matrix data to create your word grid.
3. Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4. Click "Generate Table" to display the word grid.
5. Enter words in the provided textarea.
6. Click "Submit" to initiate the word search.

## Algorithms

### Uniform Fashion (Algorithm 1)

This algorithm systematically searches for words in the grid, considering all possible directions. The agent, in uniform fashion, follows a homogeneous path, meaning that all the cells in the path share the same direction.

### Non-uniform Fashion (Algorithm 2)

A more intricate algorithm that uses non-uniform fashion, employing depth-first search techniques for word exploration. Unlike the uniform search, the non-uniform search allows the agent to follow paths with varying directions, providing a more flexible and nuanced word search experience.
